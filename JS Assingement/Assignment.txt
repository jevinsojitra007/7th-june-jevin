1. What is JavaScript? 
                 
              >  JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.

2.  What is the use of isNaN function? 

               > The isNaN() function is used to check whether a given value is an illegal number or not. It returns true if value is a NaN else returns false. It is different from the Number.

3. • What is negative Infinity? 

               >  NEGATIVE_INFINITY is the same as the negative value of the global object's Infinity property. This value behaves slightly differently than mathematical infinity: Any positive value, including POSITIVE_INFINITY , multiplied by NEGATIVE_INFINITY is NEGATIVE_INFINITY .

4. • Which company developed JavaScript? 

               >     Netscape
               >     The first ever JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich at Netscape, and has since been updated to conform to ECMA-262 Edition 5 and later versions. This engine, code named SpiderMonkey, is implemented in C/C++.

5. • What are undeclared and undefined variables? 

              >       Undefined variable means a variable has been declared but does not have a value. Undeclared variable means that the variable does not exist in the program at all.

6. • Write the code for adding new elements dynamically? 

              >  document. createElement("<tagName>"); 
                 
              >   // Where <tagName> can be any HTML // tagName like div, ul, button, etc. // newDiv element has been created For Eg: let newDiv = document. createElement("div");

7. • What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState? 

              >   ViewState is to manage state at the client's end, making state management easy for end-user while SessionState manages state at the server's end, making it easy to manage content from this end too.

8. • What is === operator? 

              >      The strict equality operator (===) checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean result. Unlike the equality operator, the strict equality operator always considers operands of different types to be different.

                         :-       for/in - loops through the properties of an object
                         :-       for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
                         :-       while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
                         :-       do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

12. • How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?
